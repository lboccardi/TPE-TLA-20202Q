# Clux Programming Language

Clux is a concise programming language oriented to code with as few characters as possible. 
The goal is to put aside most words and write shorter (if a little abstract and hard to read) code.
But why?   Mainly because Clux was inspired by Scratch, JavaScript and the not-long-enough-list of joke languages in Esolang. Again, the main goal is to minimize character count in code, while keeping the readability in programs.

It is extremely recommended for Golf Code competitions.
